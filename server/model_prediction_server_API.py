# This is an example of a Flask API that will be deployed to
# an AWS backend server. This API loads the trained model
# (the .h5 file) and creates a /predict endpoint that accepts
#  a JPEG file via a POST request to the AWS server. In the
# future, a zip file may be used with multiple jpegs instead
# of one at a time. The API processes the sent image using the
# same preprocessing steps as during training (resizing to
# 128Ã—128 and normalizing it to the right specifications) and
# returns the prediction results.

# Note: This will only work if the model file (.h5) correctly predicts and
# is available on the AWS server in the correct location (or update the file
# path accordingly under MODEL_SAVE_FILE). Since the frontend and backend
# may be on different domains, the API uses CORS to allow cross-origin
# requests.
